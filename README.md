# modern-vanilla-JS-starter-kit

## Target

The creation of a small web SPA with a modern JS ecosystem around webpack. You can comfortably create a framework agnostic JS application, but (c) "Thinking in React" with reactivity based on the Redux-toolkit and Reef.js lib.

## Features for Developers

- Predictable Flux architecture
- Separation of App logic and UI
- Components architecture, rely on predictable RTK style
- All RTK features: Redux Dev Tools, slices, immer, etc.
- Jest and @testing-library/dom for tests
- @babel for: es6 to es5 and correct work with jest & ESM modules
- JSDoc as documentation + docdash as a nice looking template for JSDoc
- Husky: for pre-commit hooks
- CSS is Auto-Purge, while build creating
- Flexibility. Feel free change one library from this starter kit to another. For example you can change Redux-toolkit to vanilla Redux for reduce size of final bundle

## You can:

- git clone [this_repo_url] && cd [repo_name] && npm i (install this repo on your machine)
- npm run test (for tests)
- npm run start (for run dev server)
- npm run build (for creating public build, index.html autogenerate)
- npm run doc (for create docs for app by jsdoc)
- npm run serve (for run app local server and www)
- use VSC + Extensions: "Comment tagged templates", "lit-html", for best expierence with js template literals
